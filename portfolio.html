            <h2>Are you looking for someone that can get the Job done but also creates a fun working environment? Well here i am, I'm D'Andre. Nice to meet you. Born and Raised in Tacoma, WA(I Love the PNW!) I always had my hands on electronics my entire life. Even took a web design Class in high school. Wasn't very artsy so was discouraged from continuing it further. Until i learned about Skillspire!</h2>

            <h2>The amount of projects i've created may be small but i'd like to think of them as just the beginning! My first project was about Jon Jones, the greatest UFC Fighter of all time! Definitely a passion project for me which i heavily enjoyed doing. The second one was a Home Page for the School i attend, Skillspire. Along with a registration form that i made as well. </h2>
